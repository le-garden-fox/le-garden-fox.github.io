      <description>I think an indicator the marks the difference of a mid level and a senior level engineer is their understanding of the computer network. The two main underlyning protocols of that system are TCP and UDP. Each of those protocols has its place and use cases, but TCP is perhaps the most used when writing programms. In this article I want to explain why it is used for the majority of communications, how to debug it and illuminate it.</description>

      <description>DNS is one of the pillars of networking. Its function is easy but its implementation can be a bit opaque. My goal here is to enlighten you on DNS so that as a mid level or junior engineer you develop a greater comfort with it. Here are the main topics I want to inform you of.
 What DNS does How DNS is structured How to debug issues related to DNS  Basically I want to &amp;ldquo;unblock&amp;rdquo; you.</description>

      <description>I really appreciate young engineers that are starting their careers. They have a great deal of passion for their work, perhaps because everything is so new. This post is meant to introduce young engineers to the basics of good shell scripts.
I often get asked by young software engineers what I would recommend they focus on or learn. My answer is always two fold, networking and shell scripting. My reasopning comes from experience.</description>
